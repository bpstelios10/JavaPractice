# Java Exercises

This is a repo for practising interesting Java subjects and a good place to do some preparation for java technical
interviews.
There are modules with katas, like [java_core](src/practice/java_core), but also repos that tackle mini-projects that
could be used as home exercise/pairing exercise etc, during interview process,
like [tic-tac-toe](src/practice/tictactoe)
All solutions are a plain java project, which usually is the case for interview exercises. But if you are allowed to use
frameworks, then it only becomes easier!
For that reason, some util classes are added for testing, like Assertions for unit tests and Benchmark for simple
micro-benchmarking.

## Core Java

In [java_core](src/practice/java_core) you can find a [README.md](src/practice/java_core/README.md) file with exercises
for:

- Streams
- Optionals (wip)
- Records (wip)

and also the solution classes.

## Tic-tac-toe

In [tic-tac-toe](src/practice/tictactoe) you can find a [README.md](src/practice/tictactoe/README.md) file with
requirements for the tic-tac-toe game and also the solution classes.
